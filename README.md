# Social Network - Frontend

This project is the new version of this project: https://github.com/talitaoliveira/rede-social-front

## Why create a new version?
- Previous version was create during some new sudies
- Previous version was created just to have a MVP to show
- Previus version was create not following some best practices (TDD, Continuous Integration...)

## Idea of the new version
- Create tests
- Use TDD
- Separate components
- Use React Hooks
- Do some integration (need study more how to do)
- Learn with the previous project 
- Not ***"Reinventing the wheel"*** (on previous project I tried to configure everything from zero, webpack, service workers...)
